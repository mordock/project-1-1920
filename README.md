# Oba Quick Help @cmda-minor-web · 2019-2020
## Description
This web app can be used by kids who need a quick help with their presentation subject. If they aren't sure yet what they want, they'll be helped by the little kitty mascot to make sure they find what they're looking for. If they already know what they want or got their inspiration from the site, the user will be given some books to take a look at.
This web app makes use of the OBA and uses the microlibraries Routie and transparency.
<!-- replace the code in the /docs folder with your own, so you can showcase your work with GitHub Pages 🌍 -->

<!-- Add a nice poster image here at the end of the week, showing off your shiny frontend 📸 -->

<!-- How about a section that describes how to install this project? 🤓 -->

<!-- ...but how does one use this project? What are its features 🤔 -->

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ✅ -->
## Wishlist
- More comprehensive help if you don't have a subject yet(categories, authors, themes)
- More interactive elements or even a minigame for the kids to play during picking
